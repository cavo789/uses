# Documentation

I don't use anymore Word or PowerPoint for my documentations, just a code editor (`Visual Studio Code` most of time) to write markdown files (`.md`).

Most of time, I'm writing multiples *small* `.md` files and I use a tool to merge them into one *big* file. That file is then used by f.i. pandoc for the `docx` generation.

*Also take a look to [markdown-tips](https://github.com/cavo789/markdown-tips) repository.*
