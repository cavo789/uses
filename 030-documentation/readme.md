# Documentation

I don't use anymore Word or PowerPoint for my documentations, just a code editor (`Visual Studio Code` most of time) to write markdown files (`.md`).

Most of time, I'm writing multiples *small* `.md` files and I use a tool to merge them into one *big* file. That file is then used by f.i. pandoc for the `docx` generation.

## Pandoc

> [https://pandoc.org/](https://pandoc.org/)

Pandoc to convert markdown files to Word (`.docx`) or PDF documents.

## Mermaid

> [https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)

Mermaid and [Mermaid.cli](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli) to write flow charts, diagrams, sequences, ... just using words.

Mermaid.cli as an automation tool to convert `.mmd` files (simple text files) to a `.png` so I can directly include images in my generated documentation.
