XYplorer is a file manager for Windows. It features tabbed browsing, a powerful file search, a versatile preview, a highly customizable interface, optional dual pane, and a large array of unique ways to efficiently automate frequently recurring tasks. Itâ€™s fast, light, and portable.

A million times better than the old, basic Windows Explorer.

ðŸ’¶ XYplorer is a freemium software, you can use it for free but not all features will be available. On my own, I got a lifetime license in 2015.
