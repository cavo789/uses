## File management

### 7-Zip

> [https://www.7-zip.org/](https://www.7-zip.org/)

🗄️ 7-Zip is a file archiver with a high compression ratio.

### WinSCP

> [https://winscp.net/eng/index.php](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

The FTP client of my choice.

WinSCP supports automation! ([https://github.com/cavo789/tools_winscp](https://github.com/cavo789/tools_winscp))

*Also take a look to my [WinSCP repository](https://github.com/cavo789/tools_winscp).*

### XYplorer

> [https://www.xyplorer.com/](https://www.xyplorer.com/)

XYplorer is a file manager for Windows. It features tabbed browsing, a powerful file search, a versatile preview, a highly customizable interface, optional dual pane, and a large array of unique ways to efficiently automate frequently recurring tasks. It’s fast, light, and portable.

A million times better than the old, basic Windows Explorer.

💶 XYplorer is a freemium software, you can use it for free but not all features will be available. On my own, I got a lifetime license in 2015.

*Also take a look to my [XYplorer repository](https://github.com/cavo789/tools_xyplorer).*

💶 **Paid software.**

## Writing code

### Code quality tools

Code quality, linter, formatting tools, ... I'm using.

If you don't have time to read everything, the two BEST TOOLS are `[phpqa](#phpqa)` and `[rector](#rector)`.

#### Hadolint

> [https://hub.docker.com/r/hadolint/hadolint](https://hub.docker.com/r/hadolint/hadolint)

Lint for Dockerfile (`.dockerfile`) in a Docker image. 

Idea is to validate the syntax your your dockerfile and notify you about problems and where you can do better.

#### markdownlint

> [https://hub.docker.com/r/davidanson/markdownlint-cli2](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidanson/markdownlint-cli2)

Linter for markdown files. Thanks to the `--fix` command line arguments, markdownlint will fixes errors for you like removing trailing spaces at the end of lines.

Will warn about problems like using invalid hierarchy (you use a `H3` just after a `H2`).

Using Docker: `docker run -v $PWD:/workdir davidanson/markdownlint-cli2 README.md` (see [https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2#container-image](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2#container-image))

#### phan

> [https://github.com/phan/phan](https://github.com/phan/phan)

PHP Static Code Analyzer. To use in conjunction with [PHPSTAN](#phpstan).

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### PHP-CS-Fixer

> [https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, ...

Greatly increase code quality.

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### Copy Paste Detector

> [https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd)

Copy/Paste detector will scan and highlight (consecutive) lines of code that have been duplicated. So if you have copied/pasted a function in two or three places, phpcpd will tell you. 

If you have a block of strictly identical code in several places, it will tell you that too (and it's up to you, for example, to create a reusable function).

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### PHP Mess Detector

> [https://phpmd.org/](https://phpmd.org/)

PHP MD is a tool to check for unused variables, dead or duplicate code (*Don't repeat yourself*), ...

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### PHP Magic Number Detector

> [https://github.com/povils/phpmnd](https://github.com/povils/phpmnd)

PHPMND will scan your code and search for number. For instance:

```php
if (mb_strlen($password) > 7) {
    throw new InvalidArgumentException("password");
}
```

and suggest to define a constant instead of hard-coding the number. With a constant, the code will immediately be more readable.

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### phpqa {#phpqa}

> [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa)

Docker image that provides static analysis tools for PHP.

Using the single PHPQA image, you'll be able to run a lot of tools like `phan`, `php_codesniffer`, `php-cs-fixer`, `phpcpd`, `phpmd`, `phpmnd`, `phpstan` and much more.

Just install PHPQA and specify the tool you want to run on the command line like f.i. `docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/project" -v "$(pwd)/tmp-phpqa:/tmp" -w /project jakzal/phpqa phpcs` and followed by the correct arguments.

#### PHPStan

> [https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)

Static code analyzer for PHP; scan the code without running it and discovered potentials problems and give powerful hints to improve the code quality and stability.

To use in conjunction with [PHAN](#phan).

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### PHP_CodeSniffer

> [https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/)

PHP_CodeSniffer tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.

Thanks to `phpcbf`, PHP_CodeSniffer will reformat the code to respect standards (by default `PSR2` rules) and fix some formatting errors for you.

Then `phpcs` will warn about other violations you'll need to fix manually.

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### Psalm

> [https://github.com/vimeo/psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm)

Another PHP static code analysis. A very good complement to the others ones.

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### Rector {#rector}

> [https://github.com/rectorphp/rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector)

More than a tool, a coach.

Rector will analyze your code (static analysis) and will suggest a lot of improvements like using new syntax : you've always use `$customers = array();`; did you know you can type; since PHP 7 `$customers = [];`.

Rector will give you a lot of suggestions to improve the quality of your code and to help you to become a better PHP developer. If you're coding for f.i. PHP 7.4, Rector will detect your "old" way of doing things and will tell "hey guy, did you know that ..." and inform you of the new features of the langage.

Rector is a refactoring tool and also make a lot of automated changes to help you to f.i. convert your code from PHP 5.3 to PHP 7.4 f.i.

It's an excellent tool with an amazing support : the developer answer very fast (see [Issues](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/issues)).

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**

#### ShellCheck

Dockerized version for a shell formater i.e. a reformat tool for your Bash (`.sh`) scripts.

#### SonarQube 

> [https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube/](https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube/)

SonarQube is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality.

Also think to install [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/vscode), the addon for [Visual Studio Code](#vscode).

### Composer

> [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)

To install and manage PHP dependencies.

*Also take a look to my [Composer tips](https://github.com/cavo789/composer_tips) repository.*

See my two repositories: [https://github.com/cavo789/excel_ribbon](https://github.com/cavo789/excel_ribbon) and [https://github.com/cavo789/vba_excel_RibbonDropdown](https://github.com/cavo789/vba_excel_RibbonDropdown).

### Docker

> [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)

💘 How to say? Docker is an amazing tool allowing you to download a software (embebed in a single file called `image`) and to run it using a single `docker run` command. Nothing to install, nothing to configure, ... just to read how to use the image.

Docker is a wonderful software working both on Mac, Windows and Linux. A must have for any developpers.

And if you're a developper, you can create your own image and publish it on [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) (public or private).

### GIT

> [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

Is it useful to explain what GIT is?

See also my tips repo: [https://github.com/cavo789/git_tips](https://github.com/cavo789/git_tips).

### Windows Terminal {#windows-terminal}

> [https://github.com/microsoft/terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

A billion better than the old `DOS` prompt or `Powershell IDE`: using `Windows Terminal`, you'll have one window where you'll be able to start DOS, Powershell, Ubuntu, Debian, a SSH interface and much more. One window means that each prompt will have his own tab.

Windows Terminal support customization like f.i. themes.

See also my tips repo: [https://github.com/cavo789/windows_terminal_tips](https://github.com/cavo789/windows_terminal_tips).

### Winmerge

> [https://winmerge.org/](https://winmerge.org/)

To compare two files and detect differences. Works for folders too.

I also use [https://www.diffchecker.com/](https://www.diffchecker.com/) when I didn't have Winmerge on my computer since it's an online tool here.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux {#wsl2}

> [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

Working under Windows, as from Windows 10 you can enable `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and then install a Linux distribution (of your choice) like `Debian` or `Ubuntu`. 

The installation process is even simplier with Windows 11.

You'll then be able to start your computer on Windows and, simply, start Linux using a prompt (see `[Windows Terminal](#windows-terminal)`).

On my side, since I'm coding most of the time with PHP and Bash, I turn on my computer on Windows, start the terminal, open a Linux prompt (which is my default prompt) and run [Visual Studio Code](#vscode) from the prompt (just by typing `code .` on the prompt).

It's just like I was on a Linux machine but no, I'm on my Windows, familial computer. It's just crazy, really!

### ZSH 

See also my tips repo: [https://github.com/cavo789/oh-my-zsh-tips](https://github.com/cavo789/oh-my-zsh-tips).

> 
Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.

#### Powerlevel10k

> [https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

The best theme for ZSH I think.

## Documentation

I don't use anymore Word or PowerPoint for my documentations, just a code editor (`Visual Studio Code` most of time) to write markdown files (`.md`).

Most of time, I'm writing multiples *small* `.md` files and I use a tool to merge them into one *big* file. That file is then used by f.i. pandoc for the `docx` generation.

*Also take a look to [markdown-tips](https://github.com/cavo789/markdown-tips) repository.*

### Mermaid

> [https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)

Mermaid and [Mermaid.cli](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli) to write flow charts, diagrams, sequences, ... just using words.

Mermaid.cli as an automation tool to convert `.mmd` files (simple text files) to a `.png` so I can directly include images in my generated documentation.

### Pandoc

> [https://pandoc.org/](https://pandoc.org/)

Pandoc to convert markdown files to Word (`.docx`) or PDF documents.
