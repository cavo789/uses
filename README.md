#### Rector

More than a tool, a coach.

Rector will analyze your code (static analysis) and will suggest a lot of improvements like using new syntax : you've always use `$customers = array();`; did you know you can type; since PHP 7 `$customers = [];`.

Rector will give you a lot of suggestions to improve the quality of your code and to help you to become a better PHP developer. If you're coding for f.i. PHP 7.4, Rector will detect your "old" way of doing things and will tell "hey guy, did you know that ..." and inform you of the new features of the langage.

Rector is a refactoring tool and also make a lot of automated changes to help you to f.i. convert your code from PHP 5.3 to PHP 7.4 f.i.

It's an excellent tool with an amazing support : the developer answer very fast (see [Issues](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/issues)).
