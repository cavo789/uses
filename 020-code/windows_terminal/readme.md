A billion better than the old `DOS` prompt or `Powershell IDE`: using `Windows Terminal`, you'll have one window where you'll be able to start DOS, Powershell, Ubuntu, Debian, a SSH interface and much more. One window means that each prompt will have his own tab.

Windows Terminal support customization like f.i. themes.
