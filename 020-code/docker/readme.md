ðŸ’˜ How to say? Docker is an amazing tool allowing you to download a software (embebed in a single file called `image`) and to run it using a single `docker run` command. Nothing to install, nothing to configure, ... just to read how to use the image.

Docker is a wonderful software working both on Mac, Windows and Linux. A must have for any developpers.

And if you're a developper, you can create your own image and publish it on [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) (public or private).
