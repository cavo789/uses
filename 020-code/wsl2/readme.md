# Windows Subsystem for Linux {#wsl2}

Working under Windows, as from Windows 10 you can enable `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and then install a Linux distribution (of your choice) like `Debian` or `Ubuntu`. 

The installation process is even simplier with Windows 11.

You'll then be able to start your computer on Windows and, simply, start Linux using a prompt (see [`Windows Terminal`](#windows-terminal)).

On my side, since I'm coding most of the time with PHP and Bash, I turn on my computer on Windows, start the terminal, open a Linux prompt (which is my default prompt) and run [Visual Studio Code](#vscode) from the prompt (just by typing `code .` on the prompt).

It's just like I was on a Linux machine but no, I'm on my Windows, familial computer. It's just crazy, really!
