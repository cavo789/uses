PHP_CodeSniffer tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.

Thanks to `phpcbf`, PHP_CodeSniffer will reformat the code to respect standards (by default `PSR2` rules) and fix some formatting errors for you.

Then `phpcs` will warn about other violations you'll need to fix manually.

**The easiest way to use it is using [https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).**
