# Copy Paste Detector

> [https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd)

Copy/Paste detector will scan and highlight (consecutive) lines of code that have been duplicated. So if you have copied/pasted a function in two or three places, phpcpd will tell you. 

If you have a block of strictly identical code in several places, it will tell you that too (and it's up to you, for example, to create a reusable function).
